# Challenge: From Gandelow to Graphs ‚Äî A Space-Enabled Salmon Comeback for the Shannon

## Overview

For centuries, the Shannon Estuary was a working waterway. Traditional craft‚ÄîGandelow, Breacaun, Currach‚Äîplied salmon and herring along Clancy‚Äôs Strand, through Limerick‚ÄìPlassey, and down to Kilrush, sustaining hundreds of local jobs and distinctive boatbuilding traditions. That world unraveled within a generation: the 1929 Ardnacrusha dam, later quota regimes, and broader environmental pressures together collapsed commercial salmon fishing by the 1950s. What remains today is almost entirely recreational‚Äîand even that sits at a fragile intersection of heritage, livelihoods, and biodiversity. This challenge asks engineers to re-imagine recreational fishing on the Shannon as a 21st-century public good: safe, inclusive, economically meaningful for riverside communities, and measurably positive for the estuary‚Äôs ecology. Your solutions should connect people with the water‚Äîon foot, from shore, and in small craft‚Äîwhile honoring the estuary‚Äôs working past and ensuring that future generations can continue to experience it.

## Problem framing (guiding questions)

### Primary question:
How might we combine low-cost space data with local river knowledge to rebuild salmon/herring runs and create heritage-friendly livelihoods in the Limerick‚ÄìKilrush reach within 3‚Äì5 years?

### Complementary question: üèÜ
How might we restore and sustain recreational fish populations and angling on the River Shannon (and estuary) by 2030‚Äîboosting local livelihoods and biodiversity‚Äîthrough a community-owned, data-driven ‚Äúangling commons‚Äù that adapts in real time without displacing harms downstream or excluding long-standing users?

## Guardrails
- **Evidence-led & adaptive**: Decisions (e.g., seasonal closures, habitat actions, catch rules) adjust to live data and community feedback.  
- **Whole-system view**: River, lakes, tributaries, floodplains, and estuary‚Äîlink water quality, habitat, access, tourism, and equity.  
- **Do no harm**: Protect sensitive species/habitats; align with Irish/EU conservation and water frameworks.  
- **Local first**: Co-design with clubs, guides, youth, and riverside businesses; solutions must be operable by local groups after pilots end.

---

## Possible solutions (Best ones integrate across many different sectors)
- **Sensing & reporting**: Low-cost monitoring (angler logs, CPUE, eDNA kits, temperature/flow sensors), plus a mobile app for citizen science & stewardship.  
- **Forecasting & decisions**: A transparent model that translates data into actionable guidance (e.g., dynamic bag limits, ‚Äúrest days,‚Äù habitat priorities).  
- **Incentives & governance**: A community stewardship scheme (credits/badges/micro-grants) tied to good practices (catch-and-release quality, litter picks, invasive-species checks) and a lightweight governance charter.  
- **Habitat & access plan**: A practical, costed menu of nature-based interventions (spawning gravel rehab, bank re-naturalisation, fish passage improvements) and fair access design.  
- **Tourism & economy**: A ‚ÄúShannon Sustainable Angling‚Äù playbook for towns‚Äîbundling guides, gear, transit, and off-season nature experiences.

---

## Pick measurable targets; for example:
- **Ecological**: Upward trends in juvenile/adult indices, improved CPUE, better water-quality readings on key reaches.  
- **Human use**: Higher angler satisfaction and compliance; more first-time youth/visitors participating.  
- **Equity & trust**: Diverse stakeholder participation and transparent rule changes.  
- **Resilience**: System keeps working under heatwaves/floods via adaptive triggers.

---

### Expected outcomes (examples, not prescriptions)
- **Estuary Watch prototype**: a public dashboard that fuses satellite data (water temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll, tidal fronts) with river flow and dam-release timings to predict migration ‚Äúwindows‚Äù and water-quality pinch points.  
- **Fish-pass & flow ops concept**: data-driven recommendations for timed spill/flow regimes or micro-interventions (e.g., light/flow cues, bubble curtains) that improve smolt/return passage at critical sites.  
- **Community science toolkit**: protocols for eDNA sampling, bank sensors, and GNSS-logged observations from anglers/boats; printable field sheets; training pack for local clubs and schools.  
- **Heritage livelihoods pilot**: a plan for strictly-limited, seasonally adaptive activities (guided heritage gandelow/currach outings, tagging assistance, river tours) tied to conservation outcomes.  
- **Build an MVP**: (1) an angler-science app + CPUE dashboard, or (2) a rules engine that proposes weekly reach-by-reach guidance from sensor + log data.  
- **Test adaptive management triggers**, evaluate socio-ecological trade-offs, and create a policy brief aligning the model with Irish/EU frameworks and IFI practices.  
- **Industry & community collaborations**: pilot low-cost sensors on two contrasting reaches; train local clubs to run the system; co-brand a ‚ÄúGood Catch‚Äù standard for tackle shops and guides.  
- **Future startups & localised ecosystems**: spin out a service that bundles monitoring, forecasting, and compliance support for angling clubs and councils‚Äîsubscription + performance bonuses tied to ecological KPIs.

---

## Difficulty (choose a track)
- **Beginner**: Build a simple dashboard from open satellite layers + public flow/tide feeds for one hot-spot (e.g., Thomond Bridge).  
- **Intermediate**: Add a basic prediction model (e.g., random forest) for salmon window timing; design a weekend eDNA survey.  
- **Advanced**: Integrate multi-source data (Sentinel-2/3, Landsat, SAR) with hydrodynamics; propose an operational flow schedule and evaluate fish-passage scenarios.

---

## What‚Äôs in / out
- **In**: Limerick City ‚Üí Kilrush; salmon & herring; conservation-first interventions; <$3k prototype costs; 10‚Äì12 week build.  
- **Out**: Dam removal; new heavy infrastructure; offshore fishery management; activities that increase by-catch or violate quotas.

---

## Resources (data, tools, spaces)
- **Data**: Open satellite data (Copernicus Sentinel-2/3, Landsat); tidal/flow records; historical catch/effort where available; weather & runoff datasets.  
- **Tools**: QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Python/R, low-cost temp/turbidity loggers, GNSS phones, LoRaWAN nodes, drones (where permitted).  
- **People/places**: Local angling clubs, Abbey Fishermen heritage groups, ESB/Ardnacrusha ops, UCD/UCC labs, schools in Limerick/Kilrush.

## Inspiration (elsewhere)
- Pacific Northwest salmon passage timing using environmental cues  
- Citizen eDNA programs  
- Hydro-ops ‚Äúfish windows‚Äù  
- Elwha River recovery monitoring  
- Heritage-boat ecotourism models

## Success & evaluation (how it‚Äôll be judged)
- **Clarity**: Crisp statement of the ecological bottleneck you target and who benefits.  
- **Relevance**: Uses Shannon-specific constraints (dam releases, tides, heritage boats).  
- **Creativity**: Novel combo of space data + community practice (e.g., gandelow-based surveying).  
- **Resourcefulness**: Uses open data/low-cost sensors; feasible permits/ops.  
- **Transferability**: Method and toolkit reusable for other Irish rivers/estuaries.

---

## Impact metrics (pick ‚â•3)
- ¬± days error in predicting migration windows; % improvement over baseline.  
- Increase in verified passages (counters/eDNA hits) during recommended flows.  
- Number of trained local participants and sampling sites.  
- Heritage-tour income tied to conservation targets (e.g., 5% to monitoring fund).  
- Open dataset completeness and documentation score.

## Why this is a strong challenge
It‚Äôs locally grounded, open-ended with multiple solution paths, supports future solvers, translates to other rivers, and is inspiring‚Äîbridging tradition (gandelows, currachs) with satellites and sensors to restore a living Shannon.
